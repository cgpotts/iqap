A: We're talking about counterinsurgency operations basically.  One fine point on this, and you just touched on this point, there's a discussion over whether there should be, what they call, explicit concurrence of the U.S. ambassadors in those countries, that they know that they're going in.  Do you think that is quite an important point, isn't it?
B: Well, it is an important point.

A: Yes.  Let's talk about the 10 other states that also allow this, which is pretty much an eye opener for a lot of people. You tried a similar case in Kansas.  Basically, how will your decision here affect other state, I guess? Will it be -- have broad repercussions?
B: Well, it may have repercussions.

A: But as far as hurricane winds are one thing, but they have given the nature of their levees right now and the flood wall -- they've tried to rebuild them with these sand bags to a certain degree, they're worried about significant rain, and what that could do in terms of breaking those flood walls and levees once again.  Are they going to get some significant rain?
B: There is some rainfall to be expected from Rita.

A: Brian, on that issue of general aviation, the smaller planes, the charter flights some of them obviously very big planes, you really don't need much security to get on board one of those planes right now.  Is that a huge gap in the system?
